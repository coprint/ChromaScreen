"CHROMAPAD DATA PROTECTION POLICY\n"
"1. Introduction\n"
"This Data Protection Policy (a) applies to the Processing of Personal Data "
"by electronic means and in paper-based filing systems, (b) excludes any "
"processing of Personal Data of employees, candidates of the Company, and (c) "
"does not address obligations of chromapad.com (“ChromaPad” or “Company”) may "
"be subject to under local laws and other applicable regulatory laws. This "
"Data Protection Policy enters into force on 11.07.2024.\n"
"1.1 EU Data Protection Laws impose the Company the full observance of the "
"following principles:\n"
"Principle\n"
"Description\n"
"Lawfulness, fairness and transparency\n"
"Personal Data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent "
"manner in relation to the Data Subject.\n"
"Purpose limitation\n"
"Personal Data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate "
"purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with "
"those purposes.\n"
"Data minimization\n"
"Personal Data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary "
"in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.\n"
"Accuracy\n"
"Personal Data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\n"
"Storage limitation\n"
"Personal Data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of Data "
"Subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the "
"Personal Data are processed.\n"
"Integrity and confidentiality\n"
"Personal Data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate "
"security of the Personal Data, including protection against unauthorized or "
"unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, "
"using appropriate technical or organizational measures.\n"
"Accountability\n"
"ChromaPad, as data controller shall be responsible for, and be able to "
"demonstrate compliance with the EU Data Protection Laws.\n"

"Protection Compliance Policy, it is explained how the protection of Personal "
"Data must be achieved throughout the Company. The following main directions "
"are mandatory and explained in this document:\n"
"    • I only process Personal Data for specific Purpose(s) of Processing. I "
"know that the Purpose of Processing has a valid lawful basis,\n"
"    • I am transparent with Data Subjects. I am always informing natural "
"persons in what the Company does with Personal Data (regardless of the "
"natural person being a client, a supplier or any other business partner). "
"The fact that I obtain Personal Data of a natural person representing a "
"legal person or which is acting as an employee of a legal person does not "
"make that Personal Data less important or outside data protection area,\n"
"    • I only use Sensitive Personal Data if necessary and where expressly "
"allowed,\n"
"    • I make sure that Personal Data are up-to-date, complete and accurate,\n"

"Subjects to correct, delete or block their Personal Data,\n"
"    • I protect the Personal Data from unauthorized loss, alteration, "
"disclosure or access.\n"

"basis:\n"
"Basis\n"
"Description\n"
"Consent\n"
"The Data Subject whom the Personal Data is about has consented to the "
"Processing.\n"
"Performance of a contract\n"
"The Processing is necessary: <br>(a) in relation to a contract which the "
"Data Subject has entered into; or <br>(b) because the Data Subject has asked "
"for something to be done so it can enter into a contract.\n"
"Compliance with legal obligation\n"
"The Processing is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to "
"ChromaPad.\n"
"Legitimate interest\n"
"The processing is in accordance with the “legitimate interests” condition.\n"
"The basis for each ChromaPad’s Purpose of Processing is mentioned in "
"ChromaPad Records of Processing.\n"
"3.3 The Processing is limited to only what is necessary for achieving the "
"ChromaPad’s Purpose of Processing\n"
"3.3.1 ChromaPad’s Purposes of Processing are limited to certain categories "
"of Data Subjects and to certain categories of Personal Data (data "
"minimization)\n"
"a. Internal Regulations list the documents and thus the exact Personal Data "
"that is to be requested from Data Subject and to be processed in respect of "
"that Data Subject. On one hand, the appendices to the Internal Regulations "
"enlist the template forms and the template contracts that have to be filled "
"in and/or signed by the Data Subject. On the other hand, the Internal "
"Regulations allow the Personal Data to be collected by word of mouth "
"directly from the Data Subject and introduced directly in the IT system of "
"ChromaPad.\n"
"b. The Purposes of Processing refer to Personal Data which is not included "
"in the category of „Special Categories of Personal Data” nor in the category "
"of Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences“, as these "
"terms are defined in Section 2 of this policy.\n"
"c. Processing that entails „Special Categories of Personal Data” and/or "
"„Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences“ is to be "
"treated as an exception and is to be avoided for as much as possible (except "
"if expressly required by an Internal Regulation or the provisions of a "
"law).\n"
"d. Any supplementary Personal Data, outside the Personal Data specifically "
"mentioned in the ChromaPad Records of Processing and outside the Personal "
"Data mentioned in the Internal Regulations, cannot be requested from Data "
"Subjects unless with prior authorization from the supervisory manager and/or "
"the Data Protection Officer.\n"
"e. Any supplementary Personal Data, outside the Personal Data specifically "
"mentioned in the ChromaPad Records of Processing and outside the Personal "
"Data mentioned in the Internal Regulations, which reaches the Company "
"(either intentional or accidentally), from other source than Data Subject, "
"is to be treated as a data privacy incident and brought to the attention of "
"the Data Protection Officer.\n"
"f. Personal Data collected by ChromaPad is accurate, integral and "
"confidential (accuracy and confidentiality).\n"
"g. All Personal Data collected by ChromaPad in relation to any Purpose of "
"Processing must be accurate. Internal Regulations require that ChromaPad "
"personnel makes sure that the Personal Data obtained directly from Data "
"Subjects or indirectly is verified against relevant documentation.\n"
"h. The integrity and the confidentiality of all Personal Data collected by "
"ChromaPad in relation to any Purpose of Processing is mandatory at all "
"times. Internal Regulations require that ChromaPad personnel makes sure that "
"the Personal Data obtained directly from Data Subjects or indirectly is "
"safely stored and accessed only on a need to know basis.\n"
"3.3.2 Processing of Personal Data within ChromaPad is performed for the "
"period needed to fulfil the Purpose of Processing (storage limitation)\n"
"a. Depending on the Purpose of Processing, Personal Data collected by "
"ChromaPad is kept in either hard-copy or electronic form (or both):\n"
"    • for the time needed to accomplish the Purpose of Processing, or\n"
"    • to the extent necessary to comply with an applicable legal requirement "
"for the time mentioned by a law provision, or\n"
"    • as advisable in light of an applicable statute of limitations.\n"
"b. ChromaPad sets and implements retention period of documents (regardless "
"of their form and title which may contain or not Personal Data).\n"
"c. All personnel needs to analyze the Personal Data stored by them against "
"the decided retention periods and decide to maintain or erase Personal Data "
"accordingly.\n"
"3.3.3 Processing outside the ChromaPad’s Purposes of Processing is generally "
"forbidden (change of purpose)\n"
"    • Generally, Personal Data will be used only for the Purpose(s) of "
"Processing for which it was originally collected (original purpose). "
"Personal Data may be Processed for legitimate purposes of ChromaPad "
"different from the original purpose (secondary purpose) only if the original "
"purpose and secondary purpose are closely related.\n"
"    • It is generally permissible to use Personal Data for the following "
"secondary purposes:\n"
"        ◦ establishing the risk profile of the Data Subject or the company "
"which the Data Subject represents, or\n"
"        ◦ internal audits or investigations; or\n"
"        ◦ dispute resolution or litigation; or\n"
"        ◦ regulatory reporting purposes.\n"
"    • Any Processing of Personal Data outside the Purposes of Processing "
"specifically established in the ChromaPad Records of Processing will be "
"immediately suspended and the situation will be brought to the attention of "
"the Data Protection Officer as soon as possible.\n"
"    • Any change in the original Purpose of Processing will be assessed "
"carefully and in case of doubt, ChromaPad’s personnel will bring the matter "
"to the attention of Data Protection Officer, before executing any further "
"processing.\n"
"3.3.7 Transfer of Personal Data\n"
"    • While rendering its services, the Company can transfer data to other "
"country or international/foreign organizations but only if in that country "
"or international/foreign organizations data security is guaranteed "
"appropriately.\n"
"    • When transferring Personal Data to a state outside European Economic "
"Area, the Company provides adequate guarantees of data protection on the "
"basis of a contract concluded with that legal or physical person or "
"international organization.\n"
"3.3.8 Profiling and Automated Data Decision Making\n"
"    • Processing in ChromaPad may involve profiling, automated decision "
"making or both in case of:\n"
"        ◦ risk management purpose analyses with the view to ensure the "
"security and reliability of the debt recovery process or to prevent and "
"filter out fraud,\n"
"        ◦ periodic automatic review of the Data Subject’s payments.\n"
"    • In all such cases, ChromaPad will observe the rights of Data Subjects, "
"as mentioned under the following section.\n"

"6. CHROMAPAD ENABLES THE DATA SUBJECTS’ RIGHTS\n"
"Under Data Protection Laws, Data Subjects have strict rights:\n"
"    • the right to be informed,\n"
"    • the right of access,\n"
"    • the right to rectification,\n"
"    • the right to erase (right to be forgotten),\n"
"    • the right to restrict processing,\n"
"    • the right to data portability,\n"
"    • the right to object,\n"
"    • rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.\n"
"All ChromaPad personnel is aware and know how to react to any exercise of "
"the Data Subjects’ rights.\n"
"6.1 ChromaPad informs the Data Subjects of the Processing activity\n"
"As a rule, documents that are given to Data Subject (either forms or "
"contracts) contain all the required information for ChromaPad to observe the "
"Company’s obligations to duly inform the Data Subjects of the Processing "
"Activity. Notwithstanding the letter of the documents given to Data "
"Subjects, upon request, ChromaPad personnel will explain thoroughly to what "
"business activity is the Processing related to, what type of Personal Data "
"is requested from the Data Subject, and that Company has set-up appropriate "
"organizational and technical measures to ensure that Personal Data is kept "
"safe and confidential. In case the Data Subjects are not required to fill in "
"independently forms as Data Subjects are only required to submit certain "
"documentation or to give their Personal Data verbally, ChromaPad personnel "
"will have the obligation to inform the Data Subject of all the coordinates "
"of the Processing activity. The checklist of the aspects that need to be "
"brought to the attention of the Data Subject are the following:\n"
"What information must be supplied?\n"
"At the time the Personal Data are obtained:\n"
"Identity and contact details of the Data controller and the DPO\n"
"✓\n"
"Purpose of the Processing and the lawful basis for the processing\n"
"✓\n"
"The legitimate interests of the Data controller\n"
"✓\n"
"Categories of Personal Data\n"
"\n"
"Any recipient or categories of recipients of the Personal Data\n"
"✓\n"
"Details of transfers to third country and safeguards\n"
"✓\n"
"Retention period or criteria used to determine the retention period\n"
"✓\n"
"The existence of each of Data Subject’s rights\n"
"✓\n"
"The source the Personal Data originates from and whether it came from "
"publicly accessible sources\n"
"\n"
"Whether the provision of Personal Data is part of a statutory or contractual "
"requirement or obligation and possible consequences of failing to provide "
"the Personal Data\n"
"✓\n"
"The existence of automated decision making, including profiling and "
"information about how decisions are made, the significance and the "
"consequences\n"
"✓\n"
"6.2 In case of profiling and/or automated decision making, ChromaPad will "
"ensure the observance of the Data Subject’s rights:\n"

"data processing, of the fact of profiling/automated decision-making, the "
"range of his/her Personal Data involved in profiling, the logic involved in "
"the method applied and the possible consequences of automated decision-"
"making on the Data Subject. Where a decision can be delivered in a process "
"either entirely as a result of an automated sub-process or also with human "
"intervention, the Data Subject must then be informed of the cases where the "
"Company can make decision entirely by automated means (as a result of a sub-"
"process). When informing about the logic the automated decision-making is "
"based on, it is not necessary to disclose in detail the algorithm, formula "
"or business rationale applied (this information need not to be so in-depth "
"as to compromise the Company’s business secrets). It is suggested to present "
"the operation of automated decision-making by using examples.\n"
"b. Revision of automated decisions: The Data Subject subjected to an "
"automated decision-making is entitled to request human intervention from the "
"ChromaPad, to make his/her position known and submit an objection against "
"that decision. This right to challenge does not entitle the Data Subject to "
"force the conclusion of the contract, but to dispute the decision based on "
"automated data processing leading to the rejection of concluding the "
"contract. The Data Subject must be granted the opportunity in any case to "
"avail of his/her right to make an objection.\n"
"c. The right to object: if the legal basis for Processing is a legitimate "
"interest of ChromaPad, the Data Subject is entitled to the right to object. "
"It follows from the right to object that the Company must examine whether "
"this objection is justified (i.e. whether the Data Subject’s interests "
"override the Company’s interests) and decide on the objection.\n"
"6.3 ChromaPad personnel recognises and knows how to deal with a request from "
"Data Subjects\n"
"EU Data Protection Laws impose that any Data Subject request is responded as "
"soon as possible but no later than 30 days from receipt. ChromaPad employees "
"will treat with the utmost importance all enquiries from Data Subjects about "
"the Processing activity.\n"
"6.4 In all cases, ChromaPad employees will inform Data Subjects that they "
"may submit a formal request and/or a complaint to the designated address, "
"representing the contact details of the DPO appointed by the Company.\n"
